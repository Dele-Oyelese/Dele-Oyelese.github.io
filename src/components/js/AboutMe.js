        <p>
        My name is Ayodele Oyelese but I go by Dele for short. 
        I grew up in Kelowna BC Canada where I did my Bachelorâ€™s of Applied Science in Electrical Engineering 
        at the University of British Columbia Okanagan (UBC-O). 
        I worked in power utility work for 1.5 years before wanting to switch into Software Engineering. 
        I have experience in project management and construction and hold a CAPM title from 
        Project management institute. I love sports having played rugby for both UBC-O and U of C.
