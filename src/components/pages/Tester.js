            <h1>YYC Hub</h1>
            <p>
                YYC Hub was a project that myself and my team won Second place 
            at the YYC Hacks Hackathon. 
            <br/><br/>
            YYC Hub was an MVP wireframe of an event-based interactive map 
            focusing on hyper-localism that links directly to apartment websites.
            As more apartment buildings sign up for YYC Hub, the Hub expands, 
            creating a larger event radius.
